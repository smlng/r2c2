# r2c2
RIOT Radio Controlled Car

## Legacy

This code fragments provide the basic functionality to control the engine and
steering of the RC car using a Raspberry PI running Raspian-Linux and a
Atmel SAM-R21 Xplain Pro running [RIOT-OS](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT).

The Raspberry PI is equipped with an OpenLabs IEEE 802.15.4 transceiver and a PC
game controller (USB).

## Acknowledgement

R2C2 has its origins in the [petabot project](https://github.com/haukepetersen/Petabot)
by @haukepetersen, most of the legacy code heavily borrows from petabot. Further
details and hardware specific changes were provided by @PeterKietzmann, which are
gratefully acknowledged, too.
